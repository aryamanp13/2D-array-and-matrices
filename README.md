# Aim: To study and implement C++ 2D Array - Matrices

## Theory:
2D array: In C++, a 2D array is essentially a collection of elements arranged in rows and columns. It's a data structure that can be visualized as a table or matrix.They are stored in contiguous memory locations. The elements are stored in row-major order, meaning the elements of the first row are stored followed by the elements of the second row, and so on.
## Algorithm(for 8d):
